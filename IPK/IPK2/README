File = README
Subject = IPK
This is readme file for David Hud√°k's project to subject IPK (Computer Communications and Networks) and describes basic facts about my project.

Files included:
    makefile - calling make in shell in folder with project builds project (and file "ipk-sniffer", which will be executable solution for this project)
    main.cpp
    main.h
    README (this file)
    manual.pdf

How to run project:
    $ make
    $ ./ipk-sniffer [args]

Arguments (args) for project:
    --interface=device/-i device - if no device chosen or this argument is not used, all devices will be printed
        -- program will sniff packets from "device"
    -n number - Sniffer will sniff [number] packets. If no argument -n, sniffer will sniff only one packet.
    --arp --icmp --tcp/-t --udp/-u - arguments for filtering sniffer (only ARP packets will be sniffed etc.)
    -p port - number of filtered port. Cannot be combined with --arp and --icmp without -t or -u.

No notable extensions yet.

Have a nice day with using my program.
